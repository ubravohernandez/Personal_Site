        <td>Introducing CSS!
          <br><br> <em>As I continue my quest to achieving the title of <strong>Full Stack</strong> I have crossed the path of CSS! Although its full power and potential is unknown to me, I plan to add it to my arsenal.</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          Today we have learned the following: Inline CSS, background-color change, colorhunt.co database for colors, Internal CSS, style tag. I am slowly transitioning from hard-coding CSS to more streamlined CSS.

        <td>Things that we have learned so far:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>The anatomy of CSS sytax which is the following: <em> selector { property : value; }</em></li>
            <li>HTML attributes that specify even further what we are trying to style. Classes & ID.
              <ul>
                <li>.classe(s)_name <em>NOTE: You can have several class names in the attribute</em></li>
                <li>#id_name <em>NOTE: The ID is unique and cannot be shared.</em></li>
              </ul>
            <li>
              We are learning how to implement a favicon into out website. Useful resource is <a href="https://www.favicon.cc/">Favicon Generator.</a> To include a favicon, you will need to use a link tag and set the rel equal to an icon.

        <td><ul>
          <li>We are learnging to divide out content using <em>div</em> tags in html, and style those sections using CSS.</li>

          <li>We are diving further into our understanding of Web design by understanding that the Box Model. Some elements consist of Margin, Border, Padding, and Content Area.</li>

          <li>The display property can hold only four values, all of which have different affects on the element.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Block:</strong> Takes up an entire line. Width and heigth can be modified.</li>
            <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The only space take is enough to fit the content. Cannot modify height and width.</li>
            <li><strong>Inline-Block:</strong> Takes the best of Block and Inline</li>
            <li><strong>None:</strong> Essentially removes the element form sight.</li>
          </ul>
          Another tag related to Display:None is visibility:none. Which removes the content from site, but does not remove the space that the content takes up.

          <ul>
            <li>CSS Positioning continued. CSS has a property know as position. This includes four possible values that we can affect.
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Static:</strong> This is essentially what the web browser does normally when displaying HTML</li>
                <li><strong>Relative:</strong> This moves the position of the content relative to where it would have been if it were static. For example, position: relative; top: 50px; would move the content 50 pixels down.</li>
                <li><strong>Absolute:</strong> This allows you to change the position of a child whose parent has a relative position. </li>
                <li><strong>Fixed:</strong> This simply fixes things to the screen. (This unlocks something like a search/navigation bar!)</li>
              </ul>

          <li>There are two ways to center your content. One are is to go to the parent of your content and set text-align to center. The other way is to set the margin vaule of the content equal to auto.</li>
